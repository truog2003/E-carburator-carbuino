# e_carburator
Simple EFI injection with arduino controlling it!

To work with:

* Arduino UNO
* 2 MOSFET TIP35C to switch injector and e-TBI motor
* e_TBI ETC from GM MONTANA
* 1 electronic pedal GM HELLA MONTANA
* 1 EFI monopoint VW AP 1.8 TBI + injector (low impedance) + TPS

Work like the old way ... NO ignition control NO RPM control NO sonda lambda control, just a single/simple electronic carburator, drive by wire :)

it's work ...
